Modeling and Processing of Time Interval Data for Data-Driven Decision Support
======

Here you can find the data, and schemes used for the validation of our algorithm presented in "Modeling and Processing of Time Interval Data for Data-Driven Decision Support". We submitted the paper at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 2014 ([SMC 2014](http://smc2014.org/)).
